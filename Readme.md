## RecipeHacker-0-4-17

Adds ways to get to recipes that are currently unobtainable due to a bug in the way magazines and random recipe spawns work.
Put 2 of the magazine that grants the recipe into the Drawing Board and you can turn them into that specific recipe.
For Handwheel and 50L can, you need 1 Puuhari and 1 IC instead.
